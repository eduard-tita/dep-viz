The `deserialize()` method in the `UntypedObjectDeserializer` and `UntypedObjectDeserializer$Vanilla` classes fails to restrict recursion when deserializing nested untyped or generic objects. A remote attacker who can supply data to be deserialized by an affected application can exploit this vulnerability to cause the JVM to consume all available memory, resulting in a `StackOverflow` exception and ultimately a DoS condition.\n\n*Advisory Deviation Notice*: The Sonatype security research team has discovered that this vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.13.2.1 and 2.12.6.1 and not 2.13.0 as stated in the advisory.\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component to deserialize nested generic or untyped objects from untrusted sources."

The methods in the classes listed below fail to restrict input size when performing numeric type conversions. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by causing the application to deserialize data containing certain numeric types with large values. Deserializing many of the aforementioned objects may cause the application to exhaust all available resources, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n*Vulnerable File(s) and Function(s)*:\n\ncom/fasterxml/jackson/core/base/ParserBase.class\n- _parseSlowInt()\n- convertNumberToBigDecimal()\n\ncom/fasterxml/jackson/core/base/ParserMinimalBase.class\n- getValueAsDouble()\n\ncom/fasterxml/jackson/core/util/TextBuffer.class\n- contentsAsDecimal()\n- contentsAsDouble()\n- contentsAsFloat()\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component if it does not restrict user-supplied numeric input values prior to deserialization."
