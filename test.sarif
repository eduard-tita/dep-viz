The `deserialize()` method in the `UntypedObjectDeserializer` and `UntypedObjectDeserializer$Vanilla` classes fails to restrict recursion when deserializing nested untyped or generic objects. A remote attacker who can supply data to be deserialized by an affected application can exploit this vulnerability to cause the JVM to consume all available memory, resulting in a `StackOverflow` exception and ultimately a DoS condition.\n\n*Advisory Deviation Notice*: The Sonatype security research team has discovered that this vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.13.2.1 and 2.12.6.1 and not 2.13.0 as stated in the advisory.\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component to deserialize nested generic or untyped objects from untrusted sources."
