Remote attackers can exploit this flaw to obtain private keys via a series of crafted Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges, by forcing the server to compute a common secret using a point outside of the defined curve.\n\nExample: \n\u003e Consider a server using NIST-256 (secp256r1) elliptic curve which uses the equation `E: y^2 \u003d x^3 + ax + b`. This curve has a huge number of elements. \nHowever, if we force the server to compute with a given curve algorithm and the point\n`x: 82794344854243450371984501721340198645022926339504713863786955730156937886079`\n`y: 33552521881581467670836617859178523407344471948513881718969729275859461829010`\n(which does not belong to this NIST curve), we get only five possible results (four points and a point in infinity). \nThe resulting group of this invalid curve has an order 5.\nAs we now know all the points on the invalid elliptic curve E\u0027. If we send the invalid point P\u0027 to the server, the server computes secret sP\u0027. The secret can have only 5 possible values. If we are able to learn the result sP\u0027, we then also learn s1 \u003d s mod 5.\n\u003e\nWe repeat this for points with orders of 7, 11, 13..., until we can compute a Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and thus learn the server private key.\nFor Bouncy Castle, using NIST-256 curve, we needed about 3300 real server queries. For Oracle JCE, we needed about 17000 real server queries. \n\nReference Link: [http://web-in-security.blogspot.ca/2015/09/practical-invalid-curve-attacks.html](http://web-in-security.blogspot.ca/2015/09/practical-invalid-curve-attacks.html)\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application will be vulnerable if using \u0027Elliptic Curve\u0027 algorithms for computing signatures, or for constructing secure random number generator mechanisms.\n\nFor example:\n\u003eKey Pair Generation:\n```\nKeyPairGenerator g \u003d KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"ECDSA\", \"BC\");\n```\n\nReference Link: [http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/display/JA1/Elliptic+Curve+Key+Pair+Generation+and+Key+Factories](http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/display/JA1/Elliptic+Curve+Key+Pair+Generation+and+Key+Factories)\n\n\u003eCertificate Creation:\n```\ncertGen.setSignatureAlgorithm(SHA1withECDSA);\n```\n\nReference Link: [http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/display/JA1/X.509+Public+Key+Certificate+and+Certification+Request+Generation](http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/display/JA1/X.509+Public+Key+Certificate+and+Certification+Request+Generation)\n\nNote: The below algorithms are available for Elliptic Curve (ECDSA):\nSHA1withECDSA\nSHA224withECDSA\nSHA256withECDSA\nSHA384withECDSA\nSHA512withECDSA",

Due to the highly table driven approach used in the algorithm it turns out that if the data channel on the CPU can be monitored the lookup table accesses are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being used. There was also a leak in AESEngine although it was substantially less. AESEngine has been modified to remove any signs of leakage (testing carried out on Intel X86-64) and is now the primary AES class for the BC JCE provider from 1.56. Use of AESFastEngine is now only recommended where otherwise deemed appropriate.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n`BouncyCastle` package is vulnerable to side-channel attack. The `AES` class uses AESFastEngine for encryption\\decryption of the data. AESFastEngine uses a large static table implementation. If an attacker can observe the data accesses by the CPU, that attacker could use this information to infer information about the key used to initialize the cipher.\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component.",

This occurs in org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding. Sending invalid ciphertext that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially leaking some information about the private exponent of the RSA private key performing the encryption.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe Bouncy Castle Crypto package is vulnerable to Timing Attacks. The `decodeBlock` method in `OAEPEncoding.class`, `decodeBlockOrRandom` and `decodeBlock` methods in `PKCS1Encoding.class`, and `convertOutput` method in `RSACoreEngine.class` do not properly maintain constant time when decoding inputs of various lengths, specifically short inputs for the OAEP Decoder.

The vulnerability only affects applications that use an LDAP CertStore from Bouncy Castle to validate X.509 certificates. During the certificate validation process, Bouncy Castle inserts the certificate\u0027s Subject Name into an LDAP search filter without any escaping, which leads to an LDAP injection vulnerability.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nBouncy Castle is vulnerable to LDAP Injection attacks due to Improper Certificate Validation. The `parseDN()` method of the `X509LDAPCertStoreSpi` class propagates X.509 certificate subject names to an LDAP search filter without proper sanitization. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a certificate with a subject name that contains LDAP-related metacharacters. Execution of the modified query may expose the attacker to sensitive information contained within the application\u0027s LDAP CertStore.\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component if it uses the LDAP CertStore to validate X.509 certificates.\n\nReference: \u003chttps://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/wiki/CVE-2023-33201\u003e",

If the JCA key pair generator is not explicitly initialised with DSA parameters, 1.55 and earlier generates a private value assuming a 1024 bit key size. In earlier releases this can be dealt with by explicitly passing parameters to the key pair generator.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n`BouncyCastle` package is vulnerable to weak key generation when using DSA for encryption and/or signing. The generateKeyPair()` method in the `KeyPairGeneratorSp` class uses a small value when generating the private key. This makes it easier for an attacker to brute-force the private key, which will result in the decryption of information or impersonation of the vulnerable server.\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component.",

The `solveQuadraticEquation()` method of the `ECCurve$AbstractF2m` class does not properly validate  `F2m` parameters when importing a digital certificate containing Elliptic Curve (EC) keys. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a specially crafted certificate with an invalid `m` parameter.

The `_deserializeFromArray()` method in the `BeanDeserializer` class fails to properly detect deeply-nested arrays, which might allow malicious actors to exhaust system resources. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying an affected instance with specially-crafted data to cause a DoS condition.\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component with certain customized choices for deserialization.",

The `readExternal()` method in the `NodeSerialization` class fails to restrict allocation when `JsonNode` objects are serialized/deserialized by the JDK. Consequently, since the first `4` bytes of serialized `JsonNode` objects indicate the size of the object\u0027s contents, certain payloads with an actual byte-length of `4` may cause the application to allocate a byte array of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` in size (2Gb). A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to consume large amounts of available heap memory by submitting a payload that exploits this issue.\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component if it uses the JDK to serialize and deserialize `JsonNode` objects.\n\nReference: [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3328](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3328)",
